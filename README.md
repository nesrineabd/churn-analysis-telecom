# Customer Churn Analysis for Telecom Company

Churn in business refers to how many customers leave a company within a timeframe, often measured in subscription-based industries like telecommunications. It's crucial for companies to understand and analyze churn to boost customer retention and profitability.

## Project Overview

In this project, our objectives are to:

- Analyze and identify patterns among customers who churn by looking at common services or characteristics, using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Provide a comprehensive set of graphs and charts that visualize the data, accompanied by clear interpretations to highlight significant trends and support deeper understanding.
- Implement and evaluate various machine learning models to predict churn rates.
- Extract key findings and actionable insights from data analysis, enabling the business to implement targeted customer retention strategies and reduce this rates.


## Dataset

The dataset includes information about customers of the telecommunications company, with features that may influence churn. These features include demographic details, service usage patterns, contract types and others.

## Key Findings and Actionable Insights

- **Optimize Contract Terms**: Short-term contracts are a significant factor contributing to customer churn. To address this, consider motivating customers to choose longer-term contracts by improving the value proposition, offering discounts, or providing additional services.
- **Improve Service Offerings**: Customers with optic fiber internet service and electronic check payment methods are also more likely to churn. A thorough investigation is needed to identify the factors driving their decision to unsubscribe, which could include issues with service reliability, customer support quality, or pricing.
